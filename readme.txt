Allows admins to see an estimate of the time it would take a user to read their post.

== Description ==
This is a simple Wordpress plugin that allows admins to see an estimate of the time it would take a user to read their post. An average person reads 200 - 300 words per minute, so we used 230 as the default. Once installed, you can change this value to whatever you would like.

What this plugin offers:

*   Shows an estimate of the time it would take a user to read the post (minutes & seconds)
*   Admins can change the reading speed (words per minute), which is then reflected in the estimate
*   Shows estimated reading time on the add/edit post and posts listing pages
